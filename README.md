Install opencv-python, imutils, argparse, numpy
Save and run ShapeDetector.py in a folder named "detectorclass" in the main program folder
Write "python detect_shapes.py --image black_background_test.png" after opening terminal in the main program folder
Change the image name and format when necessary
The actual code from pyimagesearch website only worked for shapes with black background
I modified it to work for both black and white backgrounds
I do not own the rights to the test images. They were downloaded from google images
