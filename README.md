install opencv-python, imutils, argparse, numpy
save and run ShapeDetector.py in a folder named "detectorclass" in the main program folder
write "python detect_shapes.py --image nm.png" after opening terminal in the main program folder
change the image name and format when necessary
the actual code from pyimagesearch website only worked for shapes with black background
I modified it to work for both black and white backgrounds
