# Shape Detection using OpenCV

## Instructions
* Install opencv-python, imutils, argparse, numpy
* Save and run ShapeDetector.py in a folder named "detectorclass" in the main program folder
* Write "python detect_shapes.py --image black_background_test.png" after opening terminal in the main program folder
* Change the image name and format when necessary
* Press enter to show the shape names one by one from bottom to top

**Note:** The actual code from pyimagesearch website only worked for shapes with black background. I modified it to work for both black and white backgrounds as long as the shapes are not of white color. Also, I do not own the rights to the test images. They were downloaded from google images and used for educational purposes only
